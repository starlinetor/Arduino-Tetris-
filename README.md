# Arduino-Tetris-
Tetris minigame made with Arduino. 

The code is still work in progress meaning that if you want to use it you will have to manually change the pins.
Can't say if I will publish a better version considering that for now it works. 

The code is free to use, just give me credits if you use it anywere.
Thanks!
